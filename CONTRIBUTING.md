   # Edit .env with your configurations
   ```

## Making Changes

### Branching

1. **Create a Branch**

   Always create a new branch for your changes. Use a descriptive name for your branch, e.g., `feature/add-new-endpoint` or `bugfix/resolve-issue`.

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/add-new-endpoint
   ```

2. **Commit Your Changes**

   Write clear, concise commit messages. Follow the conventional commit format:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "feat: add new endpoint for user authentication"
   ```

### Coding Standards

Follow the coding standards used in the project. Ensure code consistency by adhering to:

- **JavaScript/TypeScript:** Use `ESLint` with the projectâ€™s configuration.
- **Python:** Follow PEP 8 guidelines.

### Testing

1. **Run Tests**

   Ensure all tests pass before submitting your pull request:

   ```bash
   ./test.sh
   ```

2. **Write Tests**

   Add tests for new features or bug fixes. Use the existing testing framework and structure:

   ```javascript
   // Example test case
   test('should return the correct result', () => {
     expect(myFunction()).toBe(expectedValue);
   });
   ```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push Your Branch**

   Push your changes to your forked repository:

   ```bash
   git push origin feature/add-new-endpoint
   ```

2. **Create a Pull Request**

   Navigate to the GitHub repository and create a new pull request. Provide a clear description of your changes, reference any relevant issues, and explain the rationale behind your modifications.

3. **Request Review**

   Tag reviewers and ensure you follow any discussion threads. Be open to feedback and willing to make changes based on review comments.
